# Trade History Analysis - Internship Assignment

## Project Overview
This repository contains the code and data files for the trade history analysis assignment. The task involved processing and analyzing trade data to calculate key financial metrics, including ROI, PnL, Sharpe Ratio, and MDD, based on historical trading data. A ranking algorithm was also implemented to rank accounts based on their performance metrics.

## Files in This Repository

- `trade_data.csv`: The raw CSV file containing historical trade data.
- `trade_normalized.csv`: The cleaned and normalized data after preprocessing.
- `assignment_code.py`: Python script used for data processing and metric calculation.
- `analysis_report.pdf`: A report detailing the methodology, assumptions, and findings of the analysis.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Setup and Requirements

To run the code and reproduce the analysis, please ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
